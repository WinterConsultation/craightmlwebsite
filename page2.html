    Unit 1, Outcome 2 (Review) Review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are successful<br>
    Now you have setup your blog, it’s time to get into the detail. You now need to critically review your website.<br> 
    To the bottom of your website add a review section that contains the following information. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
  2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?  E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello <br>  
  <br>
  Yes I am happy with the VS code it has a clear interface and is functional for the task of writing code in variouse languages,<br>
   I had limited knowlaledge of how to use VC Code and Trello at the start of the project, <br>
   but as I worked with it more my skills and solutions began to increase.
   <br> Im feeling more confident the more I use them as learning new and more efficient way to code is allowing me to produce better results faster.<br>
  <br>
  2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello  <br>
  <br>
  For what was being asked for these tool would be more than capable of delivering the webpage requested. 
  <br> If you have planned your project out correctly from the begining with a time line of actions that will lead to your finished project,
  <br> maintaining it as tasks are compleated is straight forward, this can be done after each task or at the end of a working session.<br>
   Trello can act like your manager reminding you of where you are and what your next steps are with alerts or time sensitive deadline reminders.
  <br> The project has the ability to expand as I can add further code as time passes and my ability increases. <br>
  <br>
  2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?  <br>
  <br> 
  A the moment the website is basic due to my skill in coding, My ideas are only limited by my ability to bring them to life. <br>
  I'm not happy with the web page at the moment due to it's basic format. I am amending the web page on an add hoc basis.<br>
   every time I learn something new or went I solve a problem it allows me to make the page more efficient and polished
  <br> <br>

  2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project <br> 
  <br> 
  I will learn how to use Classes to pre-program commands and functions to make the user experiance better. <br>
  I also wanted to add a speak to type function for the visually impared, and text to speech option also.<br>
  translation options this would allow accessability and global reach to my website. <br>
   By adding music, back grounds and embeding classes for further functionality the website would be more engaging
  <br><br>

  2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose <br>
  <br>
  Being dyslexic I was having to read and re-read the instruction to make sure I was on task,
  <br> My first attempt at a webpage was not what was asked for but gave me insight into coding and an understanding of how even writing text was different.<br>
   what I was writing on VS Code wouldn't necessarily translate to look the same on the webpage.<br>
  I will ask my tutor or a member of my team to run debugging and also after updating GitHub Im sure I will receive feedback.<br>
  I should be more adventrous with how I want things to look as at the moment I'm thinking a little basic.
  <br>
  Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review) Develop and test solutions to improve ongoing use of IT tools and systems 
  </p>
 <p>
  <div>
  
  3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency <br>
  – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? <br>
  <br>
  If I was using Trello effectivly from the begining I would have had a clear and more comprehensive structure to follow<br>
  Linking pages with CSS to html function allowed me to use more than one programing language on one page,
   <br>this enabled more functions as some codes and commands may be language specific.<br>
  <br>
  3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency <br>
  <br>
  Going forward I will take more time in the planning stage to learn project development and project management skills. 
  <br> If I were to bracking down the task into managable chunks and focusing on what codes for each section, 
  <br> or even story boarding it on paper I would have been able to forsee any potential obsticals.
   <br>  at programs and researching more methods,parameters and function im sure I would be able to produce a much slicker and professional website. <br>
  developing a project and learning how to do it at the same time was a little callenging for me <br>
  - Practice practice practice..
  <br><br>

  3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects <br>– what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? <br> 
  Knowing how to find and use open source data/code to speed up the process, I found and referenced a few thing but realised I could still edit that code to fit my needs created a foundation<br>
  If working in a team was an option there would be more content produced on a time sensative project. Plus all people bring different <br>things to the project as two heads are better than one.<br>
  <br>
  3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions <br> 
  <br>
  I was testing code on the W3schools website before adding it directly to my project.<br> 
  I used the website as a test bed so that until the section of code were just the way I wanted they couldn't alter my main code. <br>asking for feedback for others.<br>
