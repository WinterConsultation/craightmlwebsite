        About Me.<br> <p>
                <body style="background-color:powderblue;">
        

        I am a curious, creative and imaginative person by nature. I love to learn and always want to understand how things work.<br>
        My working back ground is mainly banking and private medical finance related, I worked in these sectors for around 15 years. <br>
        I had been researching emerging technologies like 3D Printing for use in the medical or house building industries and there applicable benefits to society. <br>
         but stumbled across Blockchain technology were I quickly realised that digitised assets will change the world as we know it very soon.<br>
         After down loading a few open source programs and wallets for obsuce native currencys from GitHub. <br>
         I then found a need to learn and develop my skill in programing languages.<br>
         The most common languages for blockchain programing I have come across so far are JavaScript,Solidity and Python. <br>
         This lead me to want to learn how to code so I could help build the new paradigm I have imagined for most of my life. <br>

        1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business
        <br>
        <br>
        IT is used in business for instant global communication, data storage.<br>
        Compression has replaced the need for vast amounts of paperwork through the compression of data down to the scale of the micron. <br> 
        <br> The advent of Quantum computing has allowed use to use pocket dimensions to minipulate the time needed to solve complex equasions  <br>
         Metadata is used by advertisers and marketing team to taylor their approach direct to an individual.<br>
        The main purpose that I have seen has been an increase in productivity by way of efficencys in time and man power needed. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully <br>
        – what do you need to make projects successful?  What tools?  What skills?
        <br>
        <br>
        Following a Kanban method for planning and tracking progress of the project on a linked Trello and Slack will add the structure and flow of most project from the design to launch. <br>
        Being able to read and write programing languages such as Javascript and html 5 will always be a benefit as this gives more control over the design stage and functionality. <br>
         Knowledge of programs like xCode and Visual studio code will also help with the turn-around time as you will understand what you can and can’t do before you start your design.
        <br>
        <br>
       1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. 
        <br> How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.<br>
    
         Bracking my work down into managable chunks will help me see progression I am making towards my goal.     
        <br> <br>
    <a href="https://trello.com/b/43J7dhz0/web-site-design">My Trello</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        I plan to use the Kanban method for the planning and structure of my assignment.<br>
        Being able to set deadlines and reminders will help me stay focused on the task at hand,<br>
         also this will show clearly the progress towards the goals that have been set.
        <br>
        <br>
        1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?<br>
        Cost , performance and schedule are the most common risks associated when undertaking a digital project.<br>
        <br>
        Governance risk if the board and management are engaged in fraud or other illegal activities this could impact on company reputation.<br>
        Operational risk includes risks from poor implementation and process inefficiency.<br>
        Market risks include a robust business model, foreign exchange, commodity markets, and interest rate.<br>
        Legal risks arise from legal and the costs in money and of meeting compliance for your sector.<br>
        project risks include both internal risks associated with successfully completing each stage of the project,<br>
        plus risks that are beyond the control of the project team.
        The seriousness of the risk depends on the nature and magnitude of the possible end consequences and their probabilities.<br>

        <br>
        <br>
        1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – <br>how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?  <br>
         <br>
        For a personal project I would use the tools that allow me to achieve my desired outcome, <br>
        what is my projects unless I already have a working concept.<br>
        What is the purpose of my creation - is it new or an improvement on something that already exsists?<br>
        for contracted work I would use what fits the needs of the employer and there desired outcome.<br>
        <br>
        1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.<br>
         – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control  <br><br>

        Trello is an amazing resource for planning, structure and tracking of project goals.
        Github is a useful site for open code and idea sharing.<br> The way uploads are arranged it is clear if there is an update or later version as entries are clearly labeled with version numbers 1.1 and 1.2 and so on. <br>
        I have received push notifications while logging into apps advising there is a new version of the program I am using and been advised to download the latest version before proceeding.  <br>
        <br>
        1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? <br>
        <br>
        GDPR is regulation that enshrines in law protections that defend individuals and their data.<br>
        It out line when and how people’s data can be accessed ,stored and used.<br>
        Third parties and outsourcing has lead to you information being shared and monitised more than you the individual would normally imagine.<br>
        The new laws force companies to be more transparent and accountable if things go wrong leading to the individuals being harmed. <br>
        Consent around what can and can’t be done with your data has reduced the risk of monetary exploitation. <br>
        Without explicit consent from the individual there data can’t be used this could slow down a project,<br> if you had to contact the member to advise them of how you intended to use their data and if they allow you to proceed.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br> <br>

    Unit 1, Outcome 2 (Review) Review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are successful<br>
    Now you have setup your blog, it’s time to get into the detail. You now need to critically review your website.<br> 
    To the bottom of your website add a review section that contains the following information. 
  <br>
  <br>
    </P>
  <p>
  2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?  E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello <br>  
  <br>
  Yes I am happy with the VS code it has a clear interface and is functional for the task of writing code in variouse languages,<br>
   I had limited knowlaledge of how to use VC Code and Trello at the start of the project, <br>
   but as I worked with it more my skills and solutions began to increase.
   <br> Im feeling more confident the more I use them as learning new and more efficient way to code is allowing me to produce better results faster.<br>
  <br>
  2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello  <br>
  <br>
  For what was being asked for these tool would be more than capable of delivering the webpage requested. 
  <br> If you have planned your project out correctly from the begining with a time line of actions that will lead to your finished project,
  <br> maintaining it as tasks are compleated is straight forward,this can be done after each task or at the end of a working session.
  <br>Trello can act like your manager reminding you of where you are and what your next steps are with alerts or time sensitive deadline reminders.
  <br> The project has the ability to expand as I can add further code as time passes and my ability increases. <br>
  <br>
  2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website?<br>
  Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?  <br>
  <br> 
  A the moment the website is basic due to my skill in coding, My ideas are only limited by my ability to bring them to life. <br>
  I'm not happy with the web page at the moment due to it's basic format. I am amending the web page on an add hoc basis.<br>
   every time I learn something new or went I solve a problem it allows me to make the page more efficient and polished
  <br> <br>

  2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project <br> 
  <br> 
  I will learn how to use Classes to pre-program commands and functions to make the user experiance better. <br>
  I also wanted to add a speak to type function for the visually impared, and text to speech option also.<br>
  translation options this would allow accessability and global reach to my website. <br>
   By adding music, back grounds and embeding classes for further functionality the website would be more engaging
  <br><br>

  2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose <br>
  <br>
  Being dyslexic I was having to read and re-read the instruction to make sure I was on task,
  <br> My first attempt at a webpage was not what was asked for but gave me insight into coding and an understanding<br>
   of how even writing text was different.what I was writing on VS Code wouldn't necessarily translate to look the same on the webpage.<br>
  I will ask my tutor or a member of my team to run debugging and also after updating GitHub Im sure I will receive feedback.<br>
  I should be more adventrous with how I want things to look as at the moment I'm thinking a little basic.
  <br><br>
<br>
<br>
  Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review) Develop and test solutions to improve ongoing use of IT tools and systems 
  </p>
 <p>
  
  
  3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency <br>
  – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? <br>
  <br>
  If I was using Trello effectivly from the begining I would have had a clear and more comprehensive structure to follow<br>
  Linking pages with CSS to html function allowed me to use more than one programing language on one page,
   <br>this enabled more functions as some codes and commands may be language specific.<br>
  <br>
  3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency <br>
  <br>
  Going forward I will take more time in the planning stage to learn project development and project management skills. 
  <br> If I were to bracking down the task into managable chunks and focusing on what codes for each section, 
  <br> or even story boarding it on paper I would have been able to forsee any potential obsticals.
   <br>  at programs and researching more methods,parameters and function im sure I would be able to produce a much slicker and professional website. <br>
  developing a project and learning how to do it at the same time was a little callenging for me <br>
  - Practice practice practice..
  <br><br>

  3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects <br>– what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? <br><br>

  Knowing how to find and use open source data/code to speed up the process,<br>
  I found and referenced a few thing but realised I could still edit that code to fit my needs created a foundation<br>
  If working in a team was an option there would be more content produced on a time sensative project. Plus all people bring different <br>things to the project as two heads are better than one.<br>
  <br>
  3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions <br> 
  <br>
  I was testing code on the W3schools website before adding it directly to my project.<br> 
  I used the website as a test bed so that until the section of code were just the way I wanted they couldn't alter my main code. <br>asking for feedback for others.<br> 
  </p>
  <br> 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Unit 2: Website Software Unit 2, Outcome 1 Create structures and styles for a webpage You are setting up as an independent consultant,<br>
 which is very exciting, however, you’re going to need a website of your own to highlight your skills, availability and areas of work. <br> 
It’s time for you to create a website that details you, and including pages/sections and a how you built it page: <br>  
<br>
<br>
1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page <br> 
<br>
I made a test webpage that told a story, this was to learn and understand how to write text in code.<br> 
I added YouTube video to illustrate some of my idea's to accompany the story. This allowed me to learn how to add you tube video to a web page.
<br>A little bare at the moment but this will be improved <br>
<br>

1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites <br><br>

Intellectual property law deals with the rules for securing and enforcing legal rights to inventions, designs, and artistic works. <br> Just as the law protects ownership of personal property and real estate, so too does it protect the exclusive control of intangible assets. <br>
 The purpose of these laws is to give an incentive for people to develop creative works that benefit society, 
 <br>by ensuring they can profit from their works without fear of misappropriation by others. <br><br>

<a href="https://www.hg.org/intell.html"> Reference</a> <br>
<br>
These laws mean that you have to create your own content or run the risk of heavy fines as you are stealing from the original creator and profiting from their labors. <br>
<br>
1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them <br> <br>

Depending on the impairment there would be a need for different solutions. <br>
For colour blindness you can use text to advise of colours being used, or talk with colour blind people to see what colours can be used to reduce confusion.<br>
There are also text to type services the could help dyslexic or individuals who face diffeculties with typing. <br> Devices like the MeMu Gloves with holographic keyboards will give people the ability to create in ways that previously not possable before. <br>

<br>
<br>
1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites <br>
<br>
Gif's work well for images, .PDF stands for portable document format - these are used to manage large volumes of text. <br>
.WAV for sound waves or music would be the types of files I would be using initially due to my familiarity.<br>
research would teach me better ways of displaying my content. <br>
a list of the file types, along with the applications you’ll need to get them going on your computer. this is in no way a full list<br>
<br>
.AVI | .CSS | .DOC | .EXE | .GIF | .HTML/ .HTM | .JPG/ .JPEG | .MID/ .MIDI | .MP3 | .MPG/ .MPEG | .MOV/ .QT | .PDF | .PNG | .RAM | .RAR | .TIFF | .TXT | .WAV | .ZIP <br>
