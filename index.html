        1.0 Start by writing an ‘about me’ section about your background, why you decided to come to Code Nation and about your experience so far.
        <br>
        I had been researching emerging technologies and found that digital assets will change the world as we know it. The programing for this is done in JavaScript and Python. This lead me to want to learn how to code so I could build the new paradigm. 
        <br>
        <br>
        
        1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business 
        <br>
        IT is used in business for instant global communication, data storage and compression has replaced the need for vast amounts of paperwork. Metadata is used by advertisers and marketing team to taylor their approach direct to an individual.
        <br>
        <br>
        1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? 
        <br>
        Following a Kanban method for planning and tracking progress of the project.
        Being able to read and write programing languages such as Javascript and swift will alway be a benefit as this gives more control over the design stage and functionality. Knowledge of programs like xCode and Visual studio code will help with the turn-around time as you will understand what you can and can’t do before you start your design.
        <br>
        <br>
        
    1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.  
    <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        I plan to use the Kanban method for the planning and structure of my assignment.<br>
        Being able to set deadlines and reminders will help me stay focused on the task at hand,<br> also this will show clearly the progress towards the goals that have been set.
        <br>
        <br>
        1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?<br>
        Cost , performance and schedule are the most common risks associated when undertaking a digital project.<br>
        <br>
        Governance risk if the board and management are engaged in fraud or other illegal activities this could impact on company reputation.<br>
        Operational risk includes risks from poor implementation and process inefficiency.<br>
        Market risks include a robust business model, foreign exchange, commodity markets, and interest rate.<br>
        Legal risks arise from legal and the costs in money and of meeting compliance for your sector.<br>
        project risks include both internal risks associated with successfully completing each stage of the project, plus risks that are beyond the control of the project team.
        The seriousness of the risk depends on the nature and magnitude of the possible end consequences and their probabilities.<br>

         1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – <br>how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?  
        For a personal project I would use the tools that allow me to achieve the desired outcome,<br> for contracted work I would use what fits the needs of the employer.
        1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.
         – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control  <br>
        Trello is an amazing resource for planning, structure and tracking of project goals.
        Github is a useful site for open code and idea sharing. The way uploads are arranged it is clear if there is an update or later version as entries are clearly labeled with version numbers 1.1 and 1.2 and so on. <br>
        I have received push notifications while logging into apps advising there is a new version of the program I am using and been advised to download the latest version before proceeding.  <br>
        <br>
        1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? <br>
        <br>
        GDPR is regulation that enshrines in law protections that defend individuals and their data.<br>
        It out line when and how people’s data can be accessed ,stored and used.<br>
        Third parties and outsourcing has lead to you information being shared and monitised more than you the individual would normally imagine.<br>
        The new laws force companies to be more transparent and accountable if things go wrong leading to the individuals being harmed. <br>
        Consent around what can and can’t be done with your data has reduced the risk of monetary exploitation. <br>
        Without explicit consent from the individual there data can’t be used this could slow down a project if you had to contact the member to advise them of how you intended to use their data and if they allow you to proceed.
        
        
        
        
        
         Unit 1, Outcome 2 (Review) Review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are successful Now you have setup your blog, it’s time to get into the detail. You now need to critically review your website. To the bottom of your website add a review section that contains the following information. 
        
        
        2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello  
        2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello  
        2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?  
        2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project  
        2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose  Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review) Develop and test solutions to improve ongoing use of IT tools and systems 
        
        3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?  
        3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency  
        3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?  
        3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions  Unit 2: Website Software Unit 2, Outcome 1 Create structures and styles for a webpage You are setting up as an independent consultant, which is very exciting, however, you’re going to need a website of your own to highlight your skills, availability and areas of work. It’s time for you to create a website that details you, and including pages/sections and a how you built it page:  
        
        1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page  
        1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites
        Intellectual property law deals with the rules for securing and enforcing legal rights to inventions, designs, and artistic works. Just as the law protects ownership of personal property and real estate, so too does it protect the exclusive control of intangible assets. The purpose of these laws is to give an incentive for people to develop creative works that benefit society, by ensuring they can profit from their works without fear of misappropriation by others.
        https://www.hg.org/intell.html
        These laws mean that you have to create your own content or run the risk of heavy fines as you are stealing from the original creator and profiting from their labors.
        1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them  
        Depending on the impairment there would be a need for different solutions.
        For colour blindness you can use text to advise of colours being used, or test to see what colours can be used to reduce confusion.
        
        1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites
